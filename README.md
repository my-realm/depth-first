Muse about the contents in the file `scenarios.md` upon reading through it.  

## But what is the freaking password for the given file? 

Umm, so...

1. You either need to break the encryption on the file if you don't have the password (this shouldn't be that difficult for you, if you have the right tools and skills), or  

1. You can ask for the password from me, through proper channels, via your embassy in India.
