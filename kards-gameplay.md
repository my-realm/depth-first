## Kards Gameplay and Review

Kards is a turn based, deck builder, table-top game with a very sophisticated AI for matching opponents. All of the content within the game is in English. It requires online connectivity to start, even to play against the AI opponent. Finding a human opponent is quick, thousands of players are available online at any given time. 

>This game works well on desktop, laptop, and mobile devices with low bandwidth internet connectivity. The online bandwidth used by it is merely in bytes and kilobytes per turn in a match, rather than megabytes. 

The objective of the game is to "attack the opponent's head quarters." This is accomplished by playing the cards from the hand, into the support line, and then moving the cards into the front line to be able to get close enough to attack the opponent's HQ. Some cards can attack from the support line as well. Each "battle" between players usually lasts few minutes. Most of the gameplay is around building a deck of 40 cards with the set geared towards being able to defeat the combination played by the opponent. 

The game is WWII themed and has categories of "units" based on historical military regiments that participated in WWII. The free-to-play version is sufficiently entertaining and broad enough to explore for months. Grinding through the game can be a challenge, but rewarding at 200 hours to 300 hours of gameplay. 

Each card represents a military unit with nice artwork. The unit has a "Life Strength", "Attack Strength" and an "Action Cost." All these variables are represented by numerals on the card. The card may also have a "Deployment Effect" which triggers as soon as the card is played. Some cards also have special features that impact the gameplay. All of these things are nicely explained in the game.    

At the start of the game, each player draws a set of cards from their deck into their hand. The player who goes first, draws 4 cards from their deck, and the one who goes second, draws 5 cards from their deck. After the first player ends their turn, the second player draws another card, as each player draws a card at the beginning of their turn. So, the second player has 6 cards at the start of their turn, but the first player had the advantage of "first move."

At the beginning of each turn, the players get at least 1 new slot for action points, and usually up to 12 maximum slots. The action points in this game are called "Kards." So, by the 12th turn, the player may have 12 Kard points to spend for making their combination of moves. The special features described on the cards can change this dynamic of how many action points are available to each player during their turn, in intricate ways.  

The game proceeds with each player placing a card onto the table, within the allotted time of their turn. If the timer ticks down, and the player does not perform any action, the turn ends. Sometimes, the game slowly ends after 3 turns of no action, if a player gets disconnected or goes AFK. There is an option to "surrender" in the battle. And the winning condition is always due to one opponent's HQ getting destroyed.   

The e-sports version of this game has "top tier players" competing for fiat money. 

Many online players have geared their strategy towards quickly attacking the opponent with cards that have low action cost with the feature known as "blitz." The blitz feature allows a card to be placed onto the table, which costs action points, moved, which also costs action points, and then attack, that also costs action points. 

So the following decks have a variety of strategies and tactics for different styles of gameplay.

Oh! And, this game has a chat module and friending option for building a contact list. The in-game chat is encrypted via Steam's auth security and by the game developer's message relay system. Eventually, you might be able to find OpenSource Int guys and gals here in the network of people playing Kards online, especially Chinese one.  

Unless your device has been compromised and your keystrokes (or taps or mouse movements) are being spied upon and recorded by someone, the chat messages sent to a contact from within the game is likely to go unnoticed by any surveillance teams, even the ones funded by the CCP. This is because an agency snooping on your online activities is only going to see the signals sent from your computer to a "game server" indicating that you were merely playing a childish card game for hours. They won't even be able to notice which of those internet packets were chat messages. 

Of course, the Steam app does NAT Traversal, so it most certainly has the potential of revealing your IP Address, but you may always assume that your private IP Address was fished by skilled agencies to begin with. The "meaning" and "intent" of an intercepted message, is anyways much more difficult to decode than the IP Address of its origin.
