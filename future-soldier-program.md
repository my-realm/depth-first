# Future Soldier Program 

What types of things can be estimated, about the future of a soldier's life on the front-lines, within the battle fields of full-spectrum modern warfare? 

## 1. Introduction

One of the very first projects I was involved in, during 2008-2009, had to do with answering the question:

>Which aspect of the military (US and NATO) requires investment and development now, so that its soldiers can handle the upcoming challenges of the future, with a 10 year, and a 30 year horizon? 

Let me first explain different parts of the above question. 

The idea that a military is deficient or lacking, in some area, is almost never admitted by any country's government. However, as realists, it is necessary to acknowledge the fact that, a military platoon or a squad, is able to handle a current-day challenge, only because of investments made 10 to 30 years ago, into the equipment, education, training, and readiness of those troops. With each consecutive year that passes by, a new challenge crops up, and when a particular challenge is not met by any of the strategists and tacticians, it becomes evident that a shift in attitudes and "visioning" is needed, to quickly ramp up production as well as deployment of necessary resources. 

An example of a military realizing things too late, was the Japanese military prior to World War I, when its insular and traditional approach to warfare, prevented it from investing in rifles, riflemen, air crafts, pilots, submarines, submariners, surface-to-air ballistics, digital communication methods, along with all of the logistical supply lines and human resource development programs that had gone into shaping the preparedness, of modern units belonging to British and American armed forces. 

Of course, the Japanese rapidly improved their readiness, but then decided to ally with German Imperialists and Nazi forces, to invade Manchuria in mainland Asia, to capture the mineral and fossil fuel resources needed for driving Japan's imperial objectives. By the end of World War II, Japan again had to reevaluate its future course of research and development efforts, more acutely than all other countries of the world, due to the shocking events at Hiroshima and Nagasaki generated by America's nuclear Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). 

WWII proved to all countries alike, that there is no morally or ethically distinct form of a good or a bad move in battles, there is only the next viable move. 

So, by the time a country like India had managed to produce its indigenous nuclear weapons program, to create a single thermonuclear device that was tested at [Pokhran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiling_Buddha), it was already mid-nineteen-seventies, which was more than 30 years from when other countries in Europe and North America had started their research and development programs, for nuclear weapons based warfare. 

It is only natural for military strategists and world leaders of a country to ask, "Which areas of industrial research and development need to be prioritized now?", so that their country isn't suddenly caught unaware or unprepared down the line, in the future, during potential armed conflicts with seemingly distant, or close-by neighboring countries. 

Too bad, almost all of those think-tanks and strategic planning committee members of parliaments in various countries, simply forgot to include *[Climate Change](https://youtu.be/RtItB0TewXI)* as a factor within the plans and assessments they created 30 years ago. In fact, even now, many of them in industrialized as well as industrializing countries, still don't acknowledge Climate Change as, "a real and pressing concern." 

After [the recent COP28 meeting in Dubai, UAE,](https://youtu.be/fIxQQsUNcpc) central and chartered banks suddenly downgraded investment ratings of new, zero emission technologies in various heavy industry sectors, and yet again, decided to give priority to "'clean energy' from coal, natural gas, and crude oil." The idea that a tiny "Climate Disaster Fund" and empty promises for cutting down emissions form fossil fuel giants, will somehow improve the ability of OECD countries to face global-scale conflicts, is ludicrous. 

But, many governments across the planet, sighed with relief by the end of COP28 meetings, upon realizing that more fossil fuel will be made available from OPEC, "at a reasonable price point, and a practically guaranteed supply volume, of piped or shipped fossil fuels." Governments in way too many countries were stressed out, that none of their existing research and development projects were going to provide any kind of significant results, in the coming two decades, to meet the growing demand for electric energy and heating within their country. Particularly, the industrial-military complex in those countries, decided that it was too early to be able to shift to different forms of transportation and logistical supply chains, that aren't dependent on internal combustion engines and gas turbines. 

Moreover, the entire aviation industry of the world, currently has no commercially viable alternative to burning hydrocarbons, for activities involving production and operation of military as well as civilian air crafts and airports. It is also likely, that by the year 2043, 20 years from now, commercial airline carriers like Emirates Airlines and airplane manufacturers like Boeing, will not have a single aerial vehicle in operation for transporting freight or passengers, that can be certified as zero carbon emission vehicles. 

If airports across the world are to remain in operation, the production and supply of aviation jet fuel has to at least match the rate of growth within commercial airways, especially for domestic and international travelers, and for supply of goods by airmail. Aside from that, the portion of all globally available jet fuel, which is procured and appropriated by a country for its military, during peace time and during war, is by itself, a significant indicator of where that country's economy is heading. 

Any secret stash of aviation grade fuels, is too difficult to maintain as a secret for more than two to three years, because of corrupt and undervalued grunt workers employed by the military of each and every country, and because of advanced satellite imagery based surveillance, of every commodity's supply-chain networks. 

Compared to airways, railways in countries like China and India, are currently profit making as opposed to those in the US and Canada. All of those rail companies, with their monopolies within their respective countries, are much more prone to corruption than airways, mainly because of their continued dependence upon under-educated and very low paid non-unionized workers. Workers unions, happen to make sure that their members stay upright, honest, appropriately skilled, and decent. Demolishing workers unions, also demolishes a culture of honesty and peer-support among wage and salary earners. But, those railway companies could become more profitable and secure, when upgraded to operate on nuclear energy based electrification and communication grids. Having said that, countries like India, are practically beholden to fossil fuel overlords, from having been stigmatized by the possibility of being made to suffer like Iran, due to trade embargoes by NATO and its allies, on development of nuclear energy production and high-performance computing, in countries that aren't submissive to Washington D.C.  

So, where will soldiers need to be deployed with advanced night-vision goggles and close-combat support from aerial, terrestrial, sea, and orbital space based supply networks? Deep within the furthest parts of Central Asia, Africa, Oceania, and South America. Basically all of the locations that the erstwhile British Empire didn't manage to conquer, or ended up loosing to the idea of, "independence from imperialism and colonialism." 

As such, are there any issues and challenges that those soldiers will simply not be able to counter-act or handle, no matter the amount of investment that is dumped into their missions, within the current and the next few years, because of decisions made by leaders within NATO group of countries in the past decade? We will explore such question's answers and their antecedent factors, in this article. 


### Important Note:

Climate Change isn't only about carbon dioxide and methane emissions impacting the globe, it is also about all other emissions related to nitrogen and sulfur oxides in air, as well as toxic effluents dumped into water and soil profiles of the world, along with, 

- top soil erosion,

- excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers that cause ecological damage,

- emergence of new types of diseases impacting plants and animals at a pandemic level,

- worsening scarcity of potable water rich as well as poor countries, and 

- shift in oceanic currents.
